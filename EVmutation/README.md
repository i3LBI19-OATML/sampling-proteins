# EVmutation
Mutation effects predicted from sequence co-variation

## Please note:

*This package has been superseded by the [EVcouplings package](https://github.com/debbiemarkslab/EVcouplings), which covers the full computational pipeline including alignment generation, 3D structure prediction, and more. All functionality present in the EVmutation package is also available through EVcouplings; the repository here will only be kept as an archive and not be updated in the future.*

## Usage

### EVmutation

Python code to compute mutation effects from a graphical model inferred using plmc. This code requires an up-to-date Python 3 installation, and the following packages (we recommend using the latest [Anaconda Python 3 distribution](https://www.continuum.io) which includes all of these packages by default):
* numpy
* scipy
* pandas
* numba

### plmc

C code to infer pairwise undirected graphical models for families of biological sequences. For installation instructions, please refer to README.md in the plmc subdirectory. This subfolder contains a copy of plmc which is developed using an independent [Github repository](http://github.com/debbiemarkslab/plmc).

### Tutorial

For a tutorial on how to infer a graphical model from a sequence alignment and how to predict the effects of mutations, please see the included Jupyter notebook [EVmutation.ipynb](https://github.com/debbiemarkslab/EVmutation/blob/master/EVmutation.ipynb). The repository also includes a static HTML export of the notebook that can be viewed without a Jupyter installation.
